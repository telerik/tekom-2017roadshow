# Wash the Dishes in the Dishwasher

## Prerequisites

Prepare the dishes:

1. Remove any remaining chunks of food from the dishes.  
1. If some hardened food particles remain on the dishes, rinse them.

Load the dishwasher:

1. Put the cutlery in the cutlery basket and place it in the top rack.  
1. Arrange the plates in the bottom rack.   
1. Place bowls, pots, and pans around the plates.   
  **NOTE:** Make sure you place the bowls and pots with their bottoms facing the water spray.   

Start the dishwasher:

  **NOTE:** If you are using an extra detergent for rinse shine, place it in the dispenser.   
1. Choose the proper washing cycle.   
  **NOTE:** If you have postponed your dishwashing for the morning after, choose a longer cycle with higher water temperature. It is best to consult the user instructions of the dishwasher.
